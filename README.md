# instabot
#### Using Seleniunm, the bot calculates stats that instagram does not display.  These include accounts you follow who do not follow you back and accounts who follow you but you do not follow back.  The bot is based off of one described in a YouTube tutorial by Aaron Jack.
#### To use the bot, first make sure Google Chrome is installed.  Second, input your username and password into secrets.py, and run main.
